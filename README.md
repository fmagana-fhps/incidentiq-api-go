# incidentiq-api-go

This repository is for an IncidentIQ GoLang API Client. This is a major work in 
progress and will take quite a bit of time to complete, if at all. The goal is 
to make it easier to build applications around the API whilst going around all 
the extra steps.

I will be starting with Assets and them making my way around based on my needs 
for work. I don't know if I will do every single endpoint as some of them are
redundant. View [Endpoint.md](https://github.com/fmagana-fhps/incidentiq-api-go/Endpoint.md) to see a list of all the endpoints.
